## 🎯 Why I Built This Dashboard

Earlier this year, I assisted a friend who works for a **multinational corporation** by analyzing their sales dataset.  
The objective was to uncover patterns in revenue across different states, age groups, and product categories, while also examining the relationship between discounts and order behaviour.  

By building this dashboard, I was able to deliver clear, interactive insights that could help decision-makers understand sales dynamics and optimize business strategies.
